# The Event
PyLadies LA had a great event, **[Pi Day with PyLadies || How to Contribute to Open Source Projects & Networking](https://www.meetup.com/Pyladies-LA/events/258071911/)**, on March 14, 2019. 


## The Talk

#### How to Contribute to Open Source Projects (**[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cO37ri_S3P1ZQg_cPYIg8WMlNpVP8S7PJCstIPQh_1I/)**)

You can contribute to open source. Yes you! If you've never contributed to open source it may be challenging to know how or where to get started. However if you're willing to help contribute to open source projects, such as Python, there's a spot for you.

In this talk Ravin will cover how to go from being an open source spectator, to a project contributor. He'll cover the three most important aspects to consider when looking for a project. He'll also cover various ways to contribute, not all of which is code.

By the end of this talk you should feel both empowered, and comfortable, finding a project and joining the contributing to open source in your own way.
